pg-types@2.2.0

Repository: https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-types

# pg-types

This is the code that turns all the raw text from postgres into JavaScript types for [node-postgres](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres.git)

## use

This module is consumed and exported from the root `pg` object of node-postgres.  To access it, do the following:

```js
var types = require('pg').types
```

Generally what you'll want to do is override how a specific data-type is parsed and turned into a JavaScript type.  By default the PostgreSQL backend server returns everything as strings.  Every data type corresponds to a unique `OID` within the server, and these `OIDs` are sent back with the query response.  So, you need to match a particluar `OID` to a function you'd like to use to take the raw text input and produce a valid JavaScript object as a result. `null` values are never parsed.

Let's do something I commonly like to do on projects: return 64-bit integers `(int8)` as JavaScript integers.  Because JavaScript doesn't have support for 64-bit integers node-postgres cannot confidently parse `int8` data type results as numbers because if you have a _huge_ number it will overflow and the result you'd get back from node-postgres would not be the result in the datbase.  That would be a __very bad thing__ so node-postgres just returns `int8` results as strings and leaves the parsing up to you.  Let's say that you know you don't and wont ever have numbers greater than `int4` in your database, but you're tired of recieving results from the `COUNT(*)` function as strings (because that function returns `int8`).  You would do this:

```js
var types = require('pg').types
types.setTypeParser(20, function(val) {
  return parseInt(val)
})
```

__boom__: now you get numbers instead of strings.

Just as another example -- not saying this is a good idea -- let's say you want to return all dates from your database as [moment](http://momentjs.com/docs/) objects.  Okay, do this:

```js
var types = require('pg').types
var moment = require('moment')
var parseFn = function(val) {
   return val === null ? null : moment(val)
}
types.setTypeParser(types.builtins.TIMESTAMPTZ, parseFn)
types.setTypeParser(types.builtins.TIMESTAMP, parseFn)
```
_note: I've never done that with my dates, and I'm not 100% sure moment can parse all the date strings returned from postgres.  It's just an example!_

If you're thinking "gee, this seems pretty handy, but how can I get a list of all the OIDs in the database and what they correspond to?!?!?!" worry not:

```bash
$ psql -c "select typname, oid, typarray from pg_type order by oid"
```

If you want to find out the OID of a specific type:

```bash
$ psql -c "select typname, oid, typarray from pg_type where typname = 'daterange' order by oid"
```

pgpass@1.0.5

Repository: https://github.com/hoegaarden/pgpass

# pgpass

[![Build Status](https://github.com/hoegaarden/pgpass/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/hoegaarden/pgpass/actions?query=workflow%3ACI+branch%3Amaster)

## Install

```sh
npm install pgpass
```

## Usage
```js
var pgPass = require('pgpass');

var connInfo = {
  'host' : 'pgserver' ,
  'user' : 'the_user_name' ,
};

pgPass(connInfo, function(pass){
  conn_info.password = pass;
  // connect to postgresql server
});
```

## Description

This module tries to read the `~/.pgpass` file (or the equivalent for windows systems). If the environment variable `PGPASSFILE` is set, this file is used instead. If everything goes right, the password from said file is passed to the callback; if the password cannot be read `undefined` is passed to the callback.

Cases where `undefined` is returned:

- the environment variable `PGPASSWORD` is set
- the file cannot be read (wrong permissions, no such file, ...)
- for non windows systems: the file is write-/readable by the group or by other users
- there is no matching line for the given connection info

There should be no need to use this module directly; it is already included in `node-postgres`.

## Configuration

The module reads the environment variable `PGPASS_NO_DEESCAPE` to decide if the the read tokens from the password file should be de-escaped or not. Default is to do de-escaping. For further information on this see [this commit](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/8d15e3ec4fcb735875a8a70a09ec0c62153c3329).


## Tests

There are tests in `./test/`; including linting and coverage testing. Running `npm test` runs:

- `jshint`
- `mocha` tests
- `jscoverage` and `mocha -R html-cov`

You can see the coverage report in `coverage.html`.


## Development, Patches, Bugs, ...

If you find Bugs or have improvements, please feel free to open a issue on GitHub. If you provide a pull request, I'm more than happy to merge them, just make sure to add tests for your changes.
